# Ambient Notifications for a Shape-Changing Display

## Abstract 

This thesis is about a shape-changing display, which can display information through height adjustment and led lights. An existing system was used to control the shape-changing display. This system will be examined and then redesigned with the objective to make it simpler and more compact, so that a user can take it with home. The developed system should allow visualization of real-time infor-mation from web sources. Furthermore, it should display information in an unob-trusive manner.
The displayed scenarios, for example the current or predicted temperature, can be configured in a graphical user interface. It can be specified, how the information will be displayed. This, among others, includes specification of the led colors or different visualization modes. Therefore, a concept for displaying quantitative val-ues is developed. Different animations were implemented to provide better feed-back of the developed system and scenarios.
